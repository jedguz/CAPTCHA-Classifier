# CAPTCHA-Classifier

CAPTCHA stands for the 'Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart'.

This is all well and good, but just how well can CAPTCHA from ~2007 tell apart computers and humans in 2021? In this notebook, I'll build a CNN in Keras to try and break these CAPTCHA images! Interesting noise removal techniques using OpenCV will be implemented along the way...
